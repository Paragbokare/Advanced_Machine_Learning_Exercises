# 🤖 Machine Learning Foundations Lab

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This project is a curated collection of my work on various machine learning algorithms, statistical exercises, and data science assignments. It demonstrates the application of theory to practical datasets.

## 🌟 Overview
This repository serves as a technical log of my learning journey. It covers everything from basic data cleaning to the implementation of complex predictive models. Each notebook in the `Exercises ML` folder is designed to solve a specific problem or master a particular algorithm.


## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🧠 Exercises ML
This folder contains detailed Jupyter Notebooks covering:
* **Regression Analysis:** Linear and multi-variate regression tasks.
* **Classification:** Implementations of Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more.
* **Preprocessing:** Techniques for handling missing data, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
* **Optimization:** Fine-tuning model parameters for better accuracy.
